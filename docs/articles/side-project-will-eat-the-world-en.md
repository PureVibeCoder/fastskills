# Small Things Eat the World: The Shared Pattern of Side-Projects and Skills

If you're like me, you've noticed a strange pattern:

**The most important things in the world often look the most insignificant.**

Gmail was just an engineer's side hobby.
Twitter was just an internal experiment at a failing company.
Claude Code was just one employee thinking "this should be more convenient."

These side-projects ate the entire world.

Now, the same thing is happening again.

Only this time, what's being eaten isn't industries. It's software itself.
And the thing doing the eating is called Skills.

This article is about one pattern: **Why do seemingly insignificant things have the power to disrupt the world?**

I'll prove this with two stories:
- Story One: How side-projects ate the world
- Story Two: How Skills are eating the world right now

This will be comprehensive.

This isn't the kind of article you read and forget.

This is a deep dissection of the pattern: "Small things eat the world."

Let's begin.

## I – Side-Projects Have Already Eaten the World

> "All great things were once considered impossible." — Nietzsche

In 2001, a Google engineer named Paul Buchheit started working on a small project in his spare time.

No product approval. No team allocation. No OKRs.

He just thought email sucked and wanted to see if he could make it better.

That side-project was called Gmail.

You're probably using it right now.

This isn't an isolated case.

**Slack** — The internal communication tool Stewart Butterfield's team built while working on their failed game Glitch. A side-project. Now worth tens of billions.

**Twitter** — Jack Dorsey's spare-time experiment with short messages while working at Odeo (a podcast company). A side-project. Now it's reshaped global politics.

**Instagram** — Kevin Systrom's side-project, originally called Burbn, just a check-in app. Photo filters were added later. A side-project. Sold to Facebook for $1 billion.

**Claude Code** — Anthropic employee Boris Cherkasky's side-project. Not a strategic company initiative. Just an engineer who thought "using Claude to write code should be easier," then started building. Now it's one of Anthropic's most popular products.

Do you see the pattern?

**The most important products in the world often aren't the result of "official projects."**

They're born the moment someone says "I think this thing should exist."

## II – Why Side-Projects Can Eat the World

> "Innovation comes from people saying no to the rules." — Steve Jobs

Let me tell you how big companies build products.

First, you need to write a PRD (Product Requirements Document). Then, you need to convince your manager. Then, your manager needs to convince their manager. Then, there's a resource allocation meeting. Then, ROI and priority assessments. Then, cross-functional team formation. Then, timelines and milestones.

Six months later, if you're lucky, you might get approval for an "exploration phase."

You know what happened in those six months?

**Your original intuition died.**

Because every "convincing" is a compromise. Every "review" is a dilution. Every "coordination" is a delay.

Side-projects don't need any of this.

Side-projects only need one person, on one weekend, asking themselves:

**"What if I just started building this right now?"**

Then starting.

This is why side-projects can eat the world:

**First, they don't need permission.**

Paul Buchheit didn't ask anyone before building Gmail. Jack Dorsey didn't write a PRD for Twitter. Boris didn't wait for company approval before building Claude Code.

No permission means no compromise. No compromise means the product stays pure.

**Second, they bypass organizational friction.**

The problem with big companies isn't lack of talent. It's that talent gets consumed by organizational friction. Meetings, approvals, coordination, reporting — these things eat 80% of creative energy.

Side-projects have none of this. One person, one problem, start solving immediately.

**Third, they're inherently problem-oriented.**

Nobody works on a side-project in their spare time "just because." Side-projects always start from a real pain point: email is too hard to use, team communication is too messy, writing code is too inconvenient.

Real pain points produce genuinely useful products.

**This is the first pattern of small things eating the world:**

It's not big companies beating small companies. It's frictionless individuals beating friction-burdened organizations.

## III – Software Ate the World. Now It's Agent's Turn.

> "Software is eating the world." — Marc Andreessen, 2011

In 2011, Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen wrote a famous article.

The title was simple: "Why Software Is Eating the World."

His core argument: **Every industry will be disrupted by software companies.**

Many people didn't believe it at the time.

The auto industry needs software? Ridiculous.
Retail needs software? Unnecessary.
Finance needs software? Banks have their own systems.

Thirteen years later, let's see what happened:

**Tesla** — A software company that disrupted the auto industry. Its core competency isn't engines. It's algorithms.

**Amazon** — A software company that disrupted retail. Its core competency isn't warehouses. It's recommendation systems.

**Stripe** — A software company that disrupted financial payments. Its core competency isn't licenses. It's APIs.

**Software really did eat the world.**

Every industry you can think of — healthcare, education, logistics, entertainment, agriculture — has been redefined by software.

But this isn't the end of the story.

**Now, AI Agents are eating software.**

Let me ask you a question:

When was the last time you manually opened an app and clicked through step by step to complete a task?

Now, more and more people do this instead:

"Book me a flight to Shanghai tomorrow."
"Summarize this PDF into three key points."
"Analyze this financial report and find the anomalies."

**You're no longer operating software. You're commanding AI to operate software.**

This is the AI Agent.

Traditional software is your **tool**. You use it to do things.

AI Agent is your **proxy**. It does things for you.

When you shift from "using tools" to "commanding proxies," **software itself becomes the Agent's tool.**

Every SaaS, every app, every tool is becoming a module that Agents call.

Software ate the world. Now, Agents are eating software.

But this still isn't the end of the story.

## IV – Skills Are Eating Agents

> "Skills are the soul of an Agent. Without Skills, an Agent is just an empty shell."

Let me tell you a fact that few people understand:

**An AI Agent's capability ceiling is entirely determined by the Skills it has.**

What is a Skill?

A Skill is a set of **pre-designed instructions, workflows, and domain expertise** packaged into a module that enables an Agent to execute specific types of tasks.

Let me give you an example:

Imagine you have two Claude instances.

**Instance A**: Vanilla Claude, no extra configuration.

**Instance B**: Loaded with a set of professional Skills.

You say the same thing to both: "Help me create a market research report."

Instance A will try its best, but it can only use general capabilities — it doesn't know market research best practices, doesn't know what frameworks to use, doesn't know how to structure the output.

Instance B will invoke market research Skills. These Skills contain:
- Professional frameworks for market research
- Methodologies for competitive analysis
- Best practices for data collection
- Templates for report structure

**Same Agent, different Skills, vastly different capabilities.**

It's like:

- Agent without Skills = A smart but untrained newcomer
- Agent with Skills = A smart and experienced expert

Skills determine what an Agent can do and how well it can do it.

**Skills are eating Agents.**

Because competition between Agents is fundamentally competition between Skills.

Whoever has better Skills has a more powerful Agent.

And what is a Skill?

**A Skill is just a text file. A configuration. A set of instructions.**

Looks insignificant, right?

But this seemingly insignificant thing determines the capability boundary of an Agent.

## V – Therefore, Skills Will Eat the World

Now, let me connect the entire chain:

```
Software ate the world
    ↓
AI Agents are eating software
    ↓
Skills are eating Agents
    ↓
Therefore: Skills will eat the world
```

This isn't hyperbole. This is logical deduction.

If software has penetrated every industry...
If AI Agents are taking over the operational layer of software...
If Skills determine the capability boundaries of Agents...

Then, **whoever masters Skills masters the core competitive advantage of the Agent era.**

And what is a Skill?

A text file.
A crystallization of domain expertise.
A module that can be copied, shared, and accumulated.

**It looks so insignificant — just like those side-projects once did.**

But it's eating the world.

---

## VI – The Shared Pattern of Both Eatings

Now, let me answer the question from the beginning of this article:

**Why do seemingly insignificant things have the power to disrupt the world?**

Side-projects and Skills are superficially two different stories. But behind them is the same pattern:

**First, they don't need permission.**

Side-projects don't need company approval.
Skills don't need platform certification.

No gatekeepers means innovation can happen freely.

**Second, they bypass traditional power structures.**

Side-projects bypass organizational hierarchies.
Skills bypass professional barriers.

One person can build Gmail. One person can gain expert-level capabilities through Skills.

**Third, they can be infinitely copied and distributed.**

Once a side-project succeeds, it can serve the entire world.
Once a Skill is created, it can be reused infinitely.

Marginal cost approaches zero.

**Fourth, they start from real problems.**

Side-projects begin with "I think this thing should exist."
Skills begin with "I need to solve this specific problem."

Real pain points produce real value.

This is the pattern of "small things eating the world":

**It's not big eating small. It's fast eating slow. It's pure eating compromised. It's problem-oriented eating process-oriented.**

Gmail ate the traditional email giants.
Twitter ate traditional media.
Skills are eating traditional professional barriers.

## Conclusion

Side-projects ate the world.
Skills are eating the world.

Behind both of these is the same pattern:

**Seemingly insignificant things often have the power to disrupt the world.**

Because they don't need permission.
Because they solve problems directly.
Because they're not burdened by organizational friction.

Your next side-project might be the next Gmail.
Your next Skill might be the turning point of your career.

Small things eat the world.

This is the pattern.

Go build.
